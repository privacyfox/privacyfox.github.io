					<h3>Privacy Bug in Brave Browser Exposes Dark-Web Browsing History</h3>
					<p align="justify">
						Brave has fixed a privacy issue in its browser that sent queries for .onion domains to public internet DNS resolvers rather than routing them through Tor nodes, thus exposing users' visits to dark web websites.<br>
					</p>

					<img src="https://thehackernews.com/images/-GPWALTnJxL0/YDE1sIInajI/AAAAAAAAB18/a3wZIA8fFf0ffrKm8GiLzSRYi0ktCRf8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/brave-browser-privacy.jpg"</td>
					<p>
						The bug was addressed in a hotfix <a href="https://brave.com/latest/">release</a> (V1.20.108).<br>
						Brave ships with a built-in feature called "Private Window with Tor" that integrates the Tor anonymity network into the browser, allowing users to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the darknet, without revealing the IP address information to internet service providers (ISPs), Wi-Fi network providers, and the websites themselves. The feature was added in June 2018.<br>
						<br>
						The browser packs an impressive list of features, and its performance is top notch, with great speeds and low RAM consumption. We mentioned Brave in our anonymous browser guide, and for good reason. There are many handy security and privacy features, including a built-in adblocker, “shields” that block cookies and trackers and fingerprinting, and even a Tor mode.<br><br>

						Mobile and desktop versions of Brave include a built-in adblocker, which saves you the trouble of installing a third-party extension. You can also set up a “sync chain” between your devices so that they share your bookmarks with one another.
