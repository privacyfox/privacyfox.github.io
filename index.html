<div class="content">
		
		  <p align="justify">
						Averaging out at 119,000 cyber-threats per minute, the huge figure was included in the company's annual roundup, "A Constant State of Flux: Trend Micro 2020 Annual Cybersecurity Report," released earlier today.<br>
		  </p>
			<img class="img" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/cso_cybersecurity_cyber_attack_warning_danger_threat_hack_by_matejmo_gettyimages-486818926_2400x1600-100813827-large.jpg"</td>
			<p>
						Email-borne threats such as phishing attacks accounted for 91% of the 62.6 billion threats blocked by Trend Micro last year. Nearly 14 million unique phishing URLs were detected by the company in 2020, with home networks a primary target. <br>
						<br>
						Researchers found cyber-attacks on home networks surged 210% year-on-year in 2020 to just under 2.9 billion, a figure that equates to 15.5% of all homes. The vast majority (73%) of strikes against home networks involved brute-forcing logins to gain control of a smart device or router.
<br><br>
The number of newly detected ransomware families increased 34% last year. Researchers noted an increase in the popularity of “double extortion” attacks in which attackers exfiltrate data before encrypting it so they can use the threat of publication to extort money as well as charging for the data's return. Government, banking, manufacturing, and healthcare were the sectors most targeted by ransomware gangs.
<br><br>
While a 17% fall in detections of business email compromise (BEC) attacks was recorded, the number of vulnerabilities published by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) increased 40% year-on-year. Among the flaws exploited by criminals are some dating back to 2005.

			<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>Hackers Exploit Accellion Zero-Days in Recent Data Theft and Extortion Attacks</h3></button>
<div class="content">
		
		  <p align="justify">
						Cybersecurity researchers on Monday tied a string of attacks targeting Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) servers over the past two months to data theft and extortion campaign orchestrated by a cybercrime group called UNC2546<br>
		  </p>
			<img class="img" src="https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/posts2021/Accellion%20FTA%20attacks%20extortion%20email.jpg"</td>
			<p>
						The attacks, which began in mid-December 2020, involved exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy FTA software to install a new web shell named DEWMODE on victim networks and exfiltrating sensitive data, which was then published on a data leak website operated by the CLOP ransomware gang.<br>
						<br>
						Following the slew of attacks, Accellion has patched four FTA vulnerabilities that were known to be exploited by the threat actors, in addition to incorporating new monitoring and alerting capabilities to flag any suspicious behavior. The flaws are as follows -

CVE-2021-27101 - SQL injection via a crafted Host header
CVE-2021-27102 - OS command execution via a local web service call
CVE-2021-27103 - SSRF via a crafted POST request
CVE-2021-27104 - OS command execution via a crafted POST request<br><br>

						"The Accellion system was widely used to share and store files by organisations around the world, including Transport for NSW," the Australian agency said. "Before the attack on Accellion servers was interrupted, some Transport for NSW information was taken."

<div class="content">
		
		  <p align="justify">
						Bug bounty hunter and penetration tester Vishal Bharad have discovered a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the iCloud domain which was patched by Apple.<br>
		  </p>
			<img class="img" src="https://i2.wp.com/securityaffairs.co/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Apple-botnet.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1"</td>
			<p>
						The security flaw is a stored XSS issue in icloud.com. Stored XSS vulnerabilities, also known as persistent XSS, can be used to store payloads on a target server, inject malicious scripts into websites, and potentially be used to steal cookies, session tokens, and browser data.<br>
						<br>
						This content has to be then saved and sent or shared with another user. An attacker has to then make a change or two to the malicious content, save it again, and then visit “Settings” and “Browser All Versions.”  The XSS payload would trigger after clicking on this option.
						<br>

The bug bounty hunter also provided a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) video to demonstrate the vulnerability.<br><br>

			<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>Privacy Bug in Brave Browser Exposes Dark-Web Browsing History</h3></button>
<div class="content">
		
		  <p align="justify">
						Brave has fixed a privacy issue in its browser that sent queries for .onion domains to public internet DNS resolvers rather than routing them through Tor nodes, thus exposing users' visits to dark web websites.<br>
		  </p>
			<img class="img" src="https://thehackernews.com/images/-GPWALTnJxL0/YDE1sIInajI/AAAAAAAAB18/a3wZIA8fFf0ffrKm8GiLzSRYi0ktCRf8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/brave-browser-privacy.jpg"</td>
			<p>
						The bug was addressed in a hotfix <a href="https://brave.com/latest/">release</a> (V1.20.108).<br>
						Brave ships with a built-in feature called "Private Window with Tor" that integrates the Tor anonymity network into the browser, allowing users to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the darknet, without revealing the IP address information to internet service providers (ISPs), Wi-Fi network providers, and the websites themselves. The feature was added in June 2018.<br>
						<br>
						The browser packs an impressive list of features, and its performance is top notch, with great speeds and low RAM consumption. We mentioned Brave in our anonymous browser guide, and for good reason. There are many handy security and privacy features, including a built-in adblocker, “shields” that block cookies and trackers and fingerprinting, and even a Tor mode.<br><br>

						Mobile and desktop versions of Brave include a built-in adblocker, which saves you the trouble of installing a third-party extension. You can also set up a “sync chain” between your devices so that they share your bookmarks with one another.
